### This README file constitites part of my first assignment in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

 In this assignment, we are asked to come up with three questions about a public dataset

# Business Understanding
I chose the Seattle AirBnB dataset as I live in Seattle and it seemed like a good place to start. There are a lot of headlines about the impact of AirBNB on the housing and rental market in the United States. As someone who also works in equitable housing, I wanted to dig into some of the data to see if there are any interesting correlations between the AirBNB hosts who have many listings in an area, and whether the ratings of the listings are positive or negative.

The questions are regarding the the relationship between hosts and their ratings such as:
- Do hosts with more listings correlate to lower overall review scores?
- Do the number of ratings demonstrate positive or negative experiences?  (i.e. do properties with the most ratings trend favorably or negatively)
- Do strict cancellation policies correlate to increased negative reviews?

Included in this repository is the Jupyter Notebook used to work out the questions, and the csv file, listings.csv, which is the dataset I have used to perform my analysis.

I have provided a detailed analysis in the notebook providing full visualizations and explanations of my findings.

# Conclusion:
This exercise demonstrated: 
- That there may be a correlation to the number of listings a host has and the number of negative reviews they have.

- Having a greater number of reviews does not necessarily indicate that a host has a higher rating..

- Overall, it seems like the strict cancellation policy has a higher number of reviews than the flexible cancellation policy, but the number of reviews does not necessarily impact the quality of the reviews.
